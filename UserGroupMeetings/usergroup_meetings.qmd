### User Group Meetings  

Image analysis user group consists of Rockefeller University researchers who are interested in sharing knowledge and learning from each other.  
We meet regularly to discuss the latest image analysis methods, pipelines, softwares or a new paper.

Please contact [Ved Sharma](mailto:vsharma01@rockefeller.edu) at the [Bio-Imaging Resource Center](https://www.rockefeller.edu/bioimaging/), for more details.
