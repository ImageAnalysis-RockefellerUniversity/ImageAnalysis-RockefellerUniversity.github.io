- Open the above time-lapse sequence in Fiji and run the command:
  `Plugins › Tracking › TrackMate`  

- You will be presented with a `TrackMate` window. Click `Next`.

- Select `StarDist detector` from the drop-down menu. Click `Next`.

- You can now click on the `Preview` tab, to check how well StarDist is detecting the nuclei on the current slice. If detections look fine, click next to detect nuclei in the whole time-lapse sequence.  
- Keep clicking `Next` button until you reach the `Select a tracker` window. Select `Simple LAP tracker` and click `Next`.  
  Choose settings as in the image below and click `Next`.

If you want to track splitting and/or merging events, then choose the `LAP tracker`, and tick the splitting/merging checkbox under settings.

- Keep clicking next until you reach the `Display options` window (see image below, left). Here, various display options for the tracks could be selected. Choose `Show tracks backward in time`. Play with different settings here and scroll through the stack to see the effect of these changes.  

  Please explore the three tabs at the bottom - `TrackScheme`, `Tracks` and `Spots`. A lot of statistics is hidden there, such as the raw values for each nuclei in each frame of the time-lapse. All the statistics could be exported to a CSV file.  
- Keep clicking next until you reach the last window called `Select an action` (see image below, right). Select `Capture overlay` and click `Execute` to generate a time-lapse movie with spots and tracks overlaid on top of the original data.  
- A label time-lapse movie could also be generated by selecting `Export label image` from the drop-down list and clicking `Execute`.
