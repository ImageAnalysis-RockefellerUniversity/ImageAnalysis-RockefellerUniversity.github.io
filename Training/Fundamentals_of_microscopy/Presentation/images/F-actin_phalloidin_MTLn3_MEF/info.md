Figure S4 from Sharma et al. nanofiber paper
MTLn3 and MEF cells stained with phalloidin



slide 3:
a box saying detectors can be cameras as well as confocal style detectors such as PMTs, GASPs, APDs and SilVIR detectors
will be discussed later

slide #6 put the image at the end

capital with full stops
small with semi-colon

for low light applications

Slide 13:
for almost all application,
1 or 2 flu proteins , EMCCD might be better than CMOS, check for the graph

16: becomes a problme for long exposure such as bioluminascence, neeed to use cooled camera
17: mention emccd read noise 

after 21: a slide about dynamic range

slide after cmos: different QE graph

after bit depth - equation stepahnie lecture 67, 68 , link to a website
can work out
