title: "Image analysis workshop"
---

Participants will learn the fundamentals of microscopy image analysis using ImageJ/Fiji.

Target audience:   
&emsp;- beginners in image analysis  
&emsp;- people with a few years of image analysis experience

## Learning objectives

- Understand image bit depth, file formats and metadata
- Working with multi-dimensional images (channels, time series)
- Perform common image processing tasks in Fiji more effectively:
  - adjusting brightness/contrast
  - Adding scale bar
  - ROIs
  - Intensity measurements
- Understand when to use image processing filters (Gaussian, Edge detection etc.) to help with cell/nucleus segmentation.

## Prerequisite
Participants are recommended to bring their own laptops with the latest [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) installed.

## Opening images, Image file formats, bit-depth, metadata

drag and drop - TIFF, PNG  
Bio-Formats for others  
Opening large images with different resolutions  
Bio-Formats - crop on import  

### bit-depth
dynamic range - https://svi.nl/DynamicRange

converting between bit depths - scale when converting (image clipping https://svi.nl/Image-Clipping)




## Working with multidimensional images (Channels, time series)


## Brightness/Contrast, Histogram


## Scale bar


## Thresholding - binary and label images



## ROIs, overlays


## Intensity measurements


## Image processing filters and Deep Learning
- Gaussian
- Edge detection (Canny)
