TrackMate automatically detects it and asks for dimension swapping. Click Yes.\n\nFor the detector, choose StarDist detector from the drop-down menu.\n\nFor the tracker, choose Simple LAP tracker and the following tracking settings:\nLinking max distance=5 pixel (a lower value than in Exercise 2, since the cells are not moving)\nGap-closing max distance=10 pixel\nGap-closing max frame gap=0 (since cells are not disappearing from frame-to-frame)\n\nKeep clicking the next button until you reach the Display options window (image below). Choose:\nColor spots by: Track index\nUncheck Display tracks\n\nEvery cell will be outlined in a different color. Scroll through the stack to check the accuracy of the results. If results are not optimum, go back to the detection and/or tracker steps by clicking on the previous button (green left arrow) and changing the settings under detector and tracker.\nOn the last TrackMate window called Select an action, generate a label image by selecting Export label image from the drop-down list and clicking Execute. It will generate a grayscale Z-stack.\n\nApply colors to cells with an LUT: Image › Lookup Tables › glasbey_inverted\n\nFor creating a 3D rendering, swap Z and T dimensions back to the original values by selecting Image › Properties... and entering Z=64 and T=1. Click OK.\nGenerate 3D rendering by using 3D viewer plugin: Plugins › 3D Viewer. Select Resampling factor = 1.\nIf a window pops up asking to convert the Z-stack to 8-bit or RGB image, click Yes.\nIn the ImageJ 3D Viewer window, use left mouse click and drag to rotate and inspect the volume.\n\nWell done, if you finished all 4 exercises!",

As the training progresses, training loss (red) and validation loss (blue) curves are displayed in the window (see below). If training goes well, then both the red and blue curves will decrease with more cycles (epochs) of training and stabilize around a minimum loss value (~ 1.0 in the image below). Training loss goes down from the beginning but Validation loss (blue curve) usually goes up in the beginning and then comes down and approaches the red curve.\n\n\n\nTraining deep learning model\n\n\nIf by the end of the training, red and blue curves do not stabilize to a minimum loss value, then increase the number of epochs to 20 or 30 and then run the command N2V train + predict again.\nAfter program finishes, it generates a denoised Z-stack from the trained model. You might need to run Image › Adjust › Brightness/Contrast... and hit Reset to adjust the display of the denoised image.\nThe Deep Learning model you just trained could be saved as a .ZIP file (to be used for prediction in the future) by clicking on the File actions &gt; Save to...\n\n\n\nSaving deep learning model\n\n\nTrained model could also be applied immediately on a single noisy image or a folder full of noisy images by using Predict &gt; Single image or stack or Predict &gt; Folder of images of stacks, respectively.\n\n\n\nApplying deep learning model",
